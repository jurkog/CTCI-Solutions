# CTCI-Solutions
My solutions for the book **"Cracking the Coding Interview"** by *Gayle Laakmann McDowell.*. I am hoping to score a co-op eventually so I knew that this book would help me get in the mind set of answering interview questions. Also, it turns out that programming questions are really fun and hold a brain stimulating property unlike other activities such as Sudoku.

### Why Golang then Java?
For the first section I decided to do it in Golang (Simply to get my self accustomed to the language syntax) but after making my **MouseDroid** project (mousedroid.org), I realised that my experience with Java might prove to be more useful during interviews as opposed to Golang which I am fairly new to. This is the reason why I continued to complete the rest of the questions using Java.

##Sections Completed Fully:

1. Arrays & Strings
2. Linked Lists
3. Stacks & Queues
4. Trees & Graphs
5. Bit Manipulation

### Implemented data structures

For sections 1-4 I made my own class to represent the Data Structure of each chapter. This helped in understanding the fundamental concept behind the chapter-specific data structure.
